# Python with SQL
A quick and easy way to be able to run SQL queries with Python is using SQLite. SQLite is a library that utilizes an SQL database engine. It performs relatively fast and has been proven to be highly reliable. SQLite is the most commonly used database engine in the test environment.


SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. It’s also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.
